## ✨ What's New

### 🗄️ Database Schema Enhancements

#### Table Creation (2026-02-01 to 2026-02-15)

- **Core Tables**: Created comprehensive database schema with 6 main tables and 6 join tables
    - `club`: Organisation information with a unique constraint on name
    - `ipsc_match`: Match details with club relationships and scheduling information
    - `competitor`: Competitor profiles with SAPSA numbers and personal details
    - `ipsc_match_stage`: Stage configuration with target counts and scoring parameters
    - `match_competitor`: Competitor match participation and overall results
    - `match_stage_competitor`: Detailed stage-level performance data

- **Join Tables**: Established proper many-to-many relationships
    - `club_matches`, `ipsc_match_match_stages`, `ipsc_match_match_competitors`
    - `ipsc_match_stage_match_stage_competitors`, `competitor_competitor_matches`,
      `competitor_competitor_stage_matches`

#### Schema Modifications (2026-02-14 to 2026-02-21)

- **📅 Added `date_refreshed` columns** (2026-02-14, 2026-02-15):
    - `ipsc_match.date_refreshed` - Track when match data was last synchronised
    - `match_competitor.date_refreshed` - Track when competitor match data was last updated
    - `match_stage_competitor.date_refreshed` - Track when stage results were last refreshed
    - All columns are nullable DATETIME fields for external data source tracking

- **🗑️ Removed redundant `club_name` columns** (2026-02-21):
    - `ipsc_match.club_name` - Eliminated to enforce foreign key relationship to club table
    - `match_competitor.club` - Removed to reduce data duplication and improve data integrity

### 📋 SQL Script Organisation

#### Improved Script Structure

- **`table_alter.sql`**: Consolidated schema modification scripts with clear date markers for change tracking
- **`table_create.sql`**: Maintained comprehensive table creation scripts with proper foreign key constraints
- **`table_data.sql`**: Updated seed data with corrected club names
- **`schema.sql`**: Enhanced with proper user and schema creation for both development and production
  environments

### 📚 Documentation Improvements

#### New Documentation Templates

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Introduced a structured changelog format following Keep a Changelog standards for version
  tracking and documentation
- **RELEASE_NOTES.md**: Established standardised release notes format aligned with modern documentation
  practices
- **HISTORY.md**: Added comprehensive release history with narrative descriptions for each version
- **Versioned Release Notes**: Created historical release notes (v2.0.0, v1.1.0, v1.0.0) in
  `documentation/history/` directory

#### Updated Documentation

- **LICENCE.md**: Changed from proprietary "All Rights Reserved" to MIT Licence for open source distribution
- **README.md**: Maintained comprehensive project overview with table of contents and quick start guides
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Preserved detailed architectural documentation with MySQL-specific considerations
- **SUGGESTIONS.md**: Enhanced improvement suggestions with additional guidance on change management

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### Schema Changes

📌 **Removed Columns**

- `ipsc_match.club_name` - Use `club_id` foreign key relationship instead
- `match_competitor.club` - Use `match_id` → `club_id` relationship instead

**Migration Path:**
Applications should now retrieve club information via proper JOIN operations:

```sql
-- Old approach (no longer supported):
SELECT club_name
FROM ipsc_match;

-- New approach:
SELECT c.name, c.abbreviation
FROM ipsc_match m
         JOIN club c ON m.club_id = c.id;
```

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed data consistency issues by removing denormalised `club_name` columns
- Corrected SQL script formatting and dialect consistency
- **match_competitor table**: Removed redundant `club` column to enforce proper club information retrieval via
  foreign key relationships with the club table

---

## 🚀 Improvements

### 🔐 Data Integrity

- Enhanced referential integrity by enforcing club relationships through foreign keys only
- Added temporal tracking capabilities with `date_refreshed` columns
- Improved audit trail for data synchronisation operations

### 📝 Code Quality

- Organised schema change scripts with chronological date markers
- Improved SQL script readability and maintainability
- Added proper documentation for schema evolution

### 👨‍💻 Developer Experience

- Clearer separation between development and production schemas
- Better structured SQL migration files
- Enhanced documentation templates for future releases
- **🔓 MIT Licence adoption**: Transitioned to open source licensing for wider community adoption
- **📁 Organised documentation structure**: Established `documentation/history/` directory for versioned
  release
  notes
- **📖 Comprehensive version history**: Created CHANGELOG.md and HISTORY.md for better version tracking

  scoring parameters
- `match_competitor`: Match participation records with division, power factor, and overall match results
- `match_stage_competitor`: Detailed stage performance including hit factor, stage points, and ranking

## 📦 Upgrade Guide

### For New Installations

1. Run `scripts/schema.sql` to create databases and users
2. Run `scripts/table_create.sql` to create all tables
3. Run `scripts/table_data.sql` to insert initial seed data

### For Existing Installations

1. **Backup your database** before applying changes
2. Update application code to remove references to `club_name` columns
3. Run the following migration scripts in order:
   ```sql
   -- Add date_refreshed columns (2026-02-14, 2026-02-15)
   ALTER TABLE ipsc_match ADD COLUMN date_refreshed DATETIME NULL;
   ALTER TABLE match_competitor ADD COLUMN date_refreshed DATETIME NULL;
   ALTER TABLE match_stage_competitor ADD COLUMN date_refreshed DATETIME NULL;
   
   -- Remove redundant club_name columns (2026-02-21)
   ALTER TABLE ipsc_match DROP COLUMN club_name;
   ALTER TABLE match_competitor DROP COLUMN club;
   ```
4. Update application queries to use JOIN operations for club information
5. Test all functionality thoroughly
