# Release Notes

## Version 1.1.0

**Release Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Branch:** develop → main

---

## Overview

This release focuses on schema maturity and comprehensive documentation, establishing a solid foundation for
the HPSC Database with complete table definitions, foreign key constraints, and detailed architectural
documentation. The release transforms the initial prototype into a production-ready database schema.

---

## What's New

### Database Schema Enhancements

#### Complete Schema Definition

- **Core domain tables**: Finalized definitions for `club`, `competitor`, `match`, and `match_stage` tables
  with proper data types and constraints
- **Participation tables**: Implemented `match_competitor` to track competitor participation in matches with
  division, discipline, and power factor
- **Scoring tables**: Created `match_stage_competitor` for detailed stage-level performance tracking including
  points, penalties, time, and hit factors
- **Join tables**: Added relationship tables for managing one-to-many associations between entities

#### Foreign Key Constraints

- **Referential integrity**: Implemented foreign key constraints across all tables to enforce data consistency
- **Cascade relationships**: Established proper parent-child relationships between matches, stages, and
  results
- **Constraint naming**: Applied consistent naming conventions for all foreign key constraints

### SQL Script Organization

#### Core Scripts Established

- **`table_create.sql`**: Comprehensive table creation script with all entity definitions and constraints
- **`schema.sql`**: Database and user creation scripts for development and production environments
- **`table_data.sql`**: Initial seed data for clubs (HPSC, PMPSC, SOSC)

### Documentation Improvements

#### New Documentation

- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Comprehensive architectural documentation including:
    - Target database specifications (MySQL 8.x, InnoDB, utf8mb4)
    - Data model overview with entity descriptions
    - Key relationships and integrity strategy
    - Aggregation strategy (compute-and-store approach)

- **Enhanced README.md**: Improved project overview with:
    - Table of contents for easy navigation
    - Schema entities descriptions
    - Quick start guide for DataGrip
    - Conventions and constraints documentation
    - Typical workflows supported by the schema

- **suggestions.md**: Initial improvement suggestions including:
    - Future enhancements roadmap
    - Integrity strategy guidelines
    - Indexing recommendations
    - Query/view layer suggestions

---

## Bug Fixes

- Initial release - no bug fixes applicable

---

## Improvements

### Data Integrity

- Implemented foreign key constraints to prevent orphaned records
- Added uniqueness constraints to prevent duplicate entries
- Established proper referential integrity across all entity relationships

### Code Quality

- Organized SQL scripts with clear separation of concerns
- Implemented consistent naming conventions (snake_case for columns, InnoDB for storage)
- Added comprehensive inline comments for complex relationships

### Developer Experience

- Created quick start guide for DataGrip users
- Documented conventions and constraints for developers
- Provided seed data for immediate testing and development
- Established clear project structure with organized directories

## Technical Details

### Database Changes

#### Tables Created

**Core Domain:**

- `club`: Organization entity with name and abbreviation
- `competitor`: Athlete/person entity with identity fields and SAPSA number
- `ipsc_match`: Scheduled event entity hosted by clubs
- `ipsc_match_stage`: Stage definition within matches

**Results:**

- `match_competitor`: Competitor participation in matches with division/discipline
- `match_stage_competitor`: Stage-level performance with detailed scoring

**Join Tables:**

- `club_matches`: Club to matches relationship
- `ipsc_match_match_stages`: Match to stages relationship
- `ipsc_match_match_competitors`: Match to competitors relationship
- `competitor_competitor_matches`: Competitor to match results relationship
- `competitor_competitor_stage_matches`: Competitor to stage results relationship

#### Schema Features

- Auto-increment primary keys on all tables
- Timestamp tracking (`date_created`, `date_updated`) on all entities
- Optional edit timestamps for audit trails
- Support for match divisions, disciplines, power factors, and categories

### Dependencies

**Database Requirements:**

- MySQL 8.x or compatible
- InnoDB storage engine
- utf8mb4 character set
- utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci collation

---

## Installation Guide

### For New Installations

1. Ensure MySQL 8.x is installed and running
2. Run `scripts/schema.sql` to create databases and users:
    - Creates `hpsc_dev` and `hpsc_prod` schemas
    - Creates corresponding users with appropriate permissions
3. Select your target schema (dev or prod)
4. Run `scripts/table_create.sql` to create all tables with constraints
5. Run `scripts/table_data.sql` to insert initial club seed data
6. Verify installation in DataGrip Database Explorer

### Verification Steps

1. Check that all tables are created with proper primary keys
2. Verify foreign key relationships in database diagram view
3. Confirm seed data is present in `club` table
4. Test inserting sample match and competitor data
